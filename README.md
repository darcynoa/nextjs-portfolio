This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Not the default documentation is it??

This is a rebuild of my portfolio website, and the progress of it can be checked out [right here!](https://main--dopewebexperiences.netlify.app)

If for some reason there hasn't been any change when the repo has clearly updated, I like to reset my cache to ensure it's not pulling from that data to bring up the website.

### Super excited to finish this never-ending project

###### that doesn't make any sense...
